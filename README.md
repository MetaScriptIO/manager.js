# manager.js
This repository contains the Metascript dependency manager front-end code.

Please note that you should *always* include the hosted version from MetaScript (`https://metascript.io/manager.js`) when not hosting the back-end yourself; this ensures that you always run the latest version (and are in sync with the back-end).
